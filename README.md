## ⬇️ Installing and running the project:
1. Clone recursively && cd

```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/ramos21rodrigo/42porto.ft_printf.git && cd 42porto.ft_printf
```

2. Run `make`
```
make
```

3. Now you can compile with your newly `libftprintf.a`

```
cc main.c libftprintf.a
```

## ⚙️ Makefile Available Targets:
- `make` or `make all` - Makes _libftprintf.a_

- `make clean` - Deletes all the resulting object files

- `make fclean` - Deletes _libftprintf.a_ and all the resulting object files

- `make re` - Deletes everything (object files and _libftprintf.a_) and rebuilds _libftprintf.a_
